# Key takeaways
I enjoyed reading this article because it not only addresses and answers the questions that I'm sure most Computer Science students have, but also gives us an idea of the future of the field. The author discusses how the introduction of AI in the workforce has led to fewer junior developers being hired, since a senior developer using AI tools can now produce what previously required a small team. However, rather than focusing only on this concern, he also highlights the positives that come with AI such as a 15% increase in software engineering jobs over the next ten years. Furthermore, he gives junior developers practical advice such as familiarizing yourself with AI tools until you are able to match a small team's output. As well as focusing on skills that AI can not replicate such as communication and problem-solving. Overall, the article emphasizes that AI is simply another technological shift that requires adaptation rather than fear.
